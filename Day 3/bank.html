A copy of the loan agreement along with a copy each of all enclosures quoted in the loan agreement should be furnished to the borrower.
        <br><br>(e) As far as possible, the loan agreement should clearly stipulate credit facilities that are solely at the discretion of lenders. These may include approval or disallowance of facilities, such as, drawings beyond the sanctioned limits, honouring cheques issued for the purpose other than specifically agreed to in the credit sanction, and disallowing drawing on a borrowal account on its classification as a non-performing asset or on account of non-compliance with the terms of sanction. It may also be specifically stated that the lender does not have an obligation to meet further requirements of the borrowers on account of growth in business etc. without proper review of credit limits.
        <br><br>(f) In the case of lending under consortium arrangement, the participating lenders should evolve procedures to complete appraisal of proposals in the time bound manner to the extent feasible, and communicate their decisions on financing or otherwise within a reasonable time.

     <h4>(iv) Post disbursement supervision</h4>

      <p>(a)Post disbursement supervision by lenders, particularly in respect of loans upto Rs.2 lakhs, should be constructive with a view to taking care of any" lender-related" genuine difficulty that the borrower may face.
